# System Documentation 
## 1.Background of the Organization and Data Processing Unit 
The organization is a supermarket that provides a wide range of consumer goods to its customers. 
Efficient inventory management is critical for the smooth operation of the supermarket, ensuring 
that  products  are  available  when  needed  and  reducing  waste  due  to  overstocking  or  expiration. 
The data processing unit is tasked with maintaining a computerized system that tracks inventory 
levels,  manages  supplier  and  sales  data,  and  supports  business  analytics  to  aid  in  decision-
making. 
## 2.Problem Statement 
The supermarket currently faces challenges in managing its inventory using outdated or partially 
manual  systems.  These  challenges  include  inaccurate  stock  tracking,  delayed  replenishment, 
miscommunication with suppliers, and difficulties in monitoring sales performance. Such 
inefficiencies lead to lost sales opportunities, increased operational costs, and customer 
dissatisfaction. 
## 3.Project Objectives 
- To  develop  a  centralized  database  system  that  automates  inventory  management  for  the 
supermarket. 
- To  streamline  the  tracking  of  product  stock  levels,  sales  transactions,  and  supplier 
deliveries. 
- To  provide  real-time  updates  and  reporting  tools  that  assist  in  operational  decision-
making. 
- To implement secure, role-based access for system users such as managers, cashiers, and 
inventory clerks. 
## 4.Project Scope (Coverage of the Project) 
The project will encompass: 
- Product and category management (including prices, stock, and classification) 
- Supplier and purchase order tracking

## 6.Methodology 
The project follows the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology: 
1. **Requirements Gathering** – Engage stakeholders to determine needs. 
2. **System Design** – Create the database schema and define relationships. 
3. **Development** – Implement the database using a relational DBMS (MySQL). 
4. **Testing** – Validate accuracy, performance, and usability. 
5. **Deployment** – Roll out the system across departments and train users. 
6. **Maintenance** – Provide ongoing support and updates as needed.  
data. It ensures data consistency, helps generate reports, and aids managerial decisions. 
Future improvements could include a front-end interface and mobile access.
